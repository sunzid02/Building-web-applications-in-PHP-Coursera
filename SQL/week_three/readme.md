## Assignment: Building a Multi-Table Database With Relationships
    In this assignment, you will build a copy of the "Music" database covered in lecture. You will populate your database with tracks, artists, albums and genres that are different from the ones used in class. You must include three artists, five albums, and 20 tracks in your data. Choose a genre for each track. Your tables need to be normalized as described in class.

    Then you must construct and run some queries on your data and then take screen shots of those queries and submit the screen shots as your assignment.

## Resources
    There are several sources of information so you can do the assignment:

    Lectures and materials on Database Design from www.wa4e.com
    Chapters 38, 40, and 42 from the free textbook The Missing Link: An Introduction to Web Development and Programming written by Michael Menendez and published by Open SUNY Textbooks.

## What To Hand In
    For this assignment you will hand in:

    Screen shot (JPG or PNG) of data in the Track table
    Screen shot (JPG or PNG) of all the data joined up sorted in ascending order by the album title
    Screen shot (JPG or PNG) of all of the genres for a particular artist. Hint - use JOIN, DISTINCT and WHERE
