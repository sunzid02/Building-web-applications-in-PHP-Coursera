##Assignment: Building a Simple HTML Page
In this assignment you will build a simple valid HTML5 page that demonstrates a number of tags.

##Resources
There are several sources of information so you can do the assignment:

Lectures and materials on HyperText Markup Language from www.wa4e.com

##Specifications
    Your page will be well-formed HTML5, and indicate that it is in the UTF-8 character set.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Jane Instructor 4c56ff</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    </head>
    <body>
    ...
    </body>
    </html>
    Your name and code will be different from this example.

    Your HTML must pass the validator at:

    https://validator.w3.org/nu/

    The title tag must contain your name or the string indicated by the autograder.


    You must have at least one example of the following tags: span, p, div, h1, and ul

    You must have three a tags and three li tags.

    You must have some bold text in the document and some italics text in the document but you cannot use the b or i tags.

    There is a lot of flexibility within those parameters.
